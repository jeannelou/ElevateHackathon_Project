# ElevateHack
A solution for our Elevate Hack by TD. I worked with 5 more students with this project. Learned Bootstrap on the spot while doing the front-end side.The team worked hard and helped each other to reached the goal. Teamwork is really important that's why we managed to finished the task. We didn't made it to the top but the most important thing we brought home were the knowledge we learned from each other and the experienced we had in the event.It was a great opportunity to be part of this event and I look forward for another hackathon soon.
